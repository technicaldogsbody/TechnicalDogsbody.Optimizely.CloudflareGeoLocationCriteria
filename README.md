# TechnicalDogsbody's Optimizely CloudflareGeoLocationCriteria

**A simple integration to use Cloudflare's geolocation headers with Optimizely CMS visitor groups.**

---

## **Overview**

This library extends Optimizely CMS by adding a visitor group criterion based on Cloudflare's geolocation headers. By leveraging Cloudflare's `CF-IPCountry` header, you can create location-based personalisation without requiring additional IP lookup services.

---

## **Features**

- **Easy Integration**: Adds a plug-and-play visitor group criterion.  
- **Cloudflare Native**: Utilises Cloudflare's `CF-IPCountry` header.  
- **Performance**: No external API callsâ€”geolocation data is sent directly by Cloudflare.

## **Installation**

Install via NuGet:

```
Install-Package TechnicalDogsbody.Optimizely.CloudflareGeoLocationCriteria

2. **Add to Visitor Groups**
